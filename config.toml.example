# List prerequisites for stars that have them. Some of these are hard
# requirements: for example, you need to do BOB1 for the Koopa race to
# be available to do BOB2. Other stars can be "soft requirements": for
# example if you want to unlock the cannon on BOB2 and use it on BOB5,
# then you'd put BOB2 as a prerequisite for BOB5.
#
# Stars that require a given cap have the red coin star for the cap
# stage as a prerequisite, since (I'm going to assume) it's always
# worth getting the red coin star on a cap stage if you're getting the
# cap anyway. At present this is a required assumption.
#
# The 100 coin stars must not be included in the below list; they are
# assumed to share the prerequisite relationships of the base star they
